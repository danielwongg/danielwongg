### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

8 Week SQL Challenge - Case Study #1: Danny's Diner

Objective:
Use data to answer questions about customers, such as money spent, popular products, and frequency of visits.


Database Relationship Diagram:


Case Study Questions:
1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?
3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?
What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?
Which item was the most popular for each customer?
Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?
Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?
What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?
If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier - how many points would each customer have?
In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi - how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?


## Solutions

### 1. What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?
```sql
SELECT sales.customer_id, SUM(price) AS TotalSales
FROM sales
JOIN menu
ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id;
```
#### Reasoning
-  Find total amount spent using the **SUM** function
-  Use **JOIN** function to combine two seperate tables that contain the information necessary to complete the query (```product_id``` and ```price```)
-  To sort by each customer, utilize the **GROUP BY** function
-  The **ORDER BY** function is used to further sort the query by ```customer_id``` 

#### Answer:
| customer_id | TotalSales  |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 76          |
| B           | 74          |
| C           | 36          |

From the query above we see that customer A spent $76,  customer B spent $74, and customer C spent $36.

***

### 2. How many days has each customer visited the restaurant?

```sql
SELECT sales.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT(order_date)) AS TimesVisited
FROM sales
GROUP BY customer_id;
```

#### Reasoning
- All information required to answer the question is in the Sales table (```customer_id``` and ```order-date```)
- To figure out number of days visited, I used the **DISTINCT** and **COUNT** functions. This filters out multiple orders on the same day, and converts each order date into a numerical  value that represents times visited
- Filter the results by ```customer_id``` to see the number of times each customer visited

#### Answer:
| customer_id | TimesVisited |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | 4          |
| B           | 6          |
| C           | 2          |

From the query above we see that customer A visited 4 times, customer B visited 6 times, and customer C visited 2 times.

***

### 3. What was the first item from the menu purchased by each customer?

````sql
WITH order_ranked AS
(
	SELECT customer_id, order_date, product_name,
	DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY sales.customer_id
	ORDER BY sales.order_date)
	AS ranking
	FROM sales
	JOIN menu
  	ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name
FROM order_ranked
WHERE ranking = 1
GROUP BY customer_id, product_name;
````

#### Reasoning
- Using a **MIN** function on ```order_date``` combined with the ```product_name``` would not work as it would provide me the the earliest time each customer ordered each menu item, rather than the first item they had ordered
- Creating a CTE with a **DENSE_RANK** function, a **PARTITION BY** function, and a **ORDER_BY** function provides each product ordered by the customer to be assigned a rank, seperated by ```customer_id```
- **DENSE_RANK** is used instead of **RANK** as the data does not indicate which product was ordered earlier on the same date
- Using the CTE, I then can filter the first product ordered by each customer based on ranking = 1, and a following **GROUP BY** of ```customer_id``` and ```product_name```

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| A           | sushi        | 
| A           | curry        | 
| B           | curry        | 
| C           | ramen        |

From the above query, customer A's first orders are sushi and curry, customer B's first order is curry, and customer C's first order is ramen.

***

### 4. What is the most purchased item on the menu and how many times was it purchased by all customers?

````sql
SELECT product_name, COUNT(sales.product_id) AS TimesOrdered
FROM sales
JOIN menu
ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id
GROUP BY sales.product_id, product_name
ORDER BY COUNT(sales.product_id) DESC;
````

#### Reasoning
- Conduct a **COUNT** of ```product_id``` for the number of orders made by customers
- **GROUP BY** ```product_name``` to seperate how many times each product was ordered
- Use **ORDER BY** in descending order to identify which product was ordered the most

#### Answer:
| product_name | TimesOrdered | 
| ----------- | ----------- |
| ramen       | 8	 |
| curry       | 4	 |
| sushi       | 3	 |


From the query above, we see that the most ordered product is ramen, with 8 orders total.

***

### 5. Which item was the most popular for each customer?

````sql
WITH most_ordered AS
(
    SELECT sales.customer_id, product_name, COUNT(sales.product_id) AS TimesOrdered,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY sales.customer_id
    ORDER BY COUNT(sales.product_id) DESC)
    AS ranking
    FROM sales
    JOIN menu
    ON sales.product_id=menu.product_id
    GROUP BY sales.customer_id, menu.product_name
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, TimesOrdered
FROM most_ordered
WHERE ranking = 1;
````

#### Reasoning
- Similar to question #3, I created a CTE that uses **DENSE_RANK** to rank the number of times a product was ordered based on a similar table in question #4
- I seperate the values/rankings with a **PARTITION BY** function on the ```customer_id``` and use a **ORDER BY** descending function on ```product_id```
- I then further restrict the values to return only when the rank = 1 so that I don't return products ordered less(ie. a rank not equalt to 1)

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | TimesOrdered |
| ----------- | ---------- |------------  |
| A           | ramen        |  3   |
| B           | curry        |  2   |
| B           | sushi        |  2   |
| B           | ramen        |  2   |
| C           | ramen        |  3   |

From the query above, we see that customer A's most ordered product is ramen, customer B's most ordered product is an equal amount of curry, sushi, and ramen, and customer C's most ordered product is ramen.

***

### 6. Which item was purchased first by the customer after they became a member?

````sql
WITH date_rank AS
(
    SELECT sales.customer_id, order_date, sales.product_id, join_date,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY sales.customer_id
    ORDER BY order_date)
    AS ranking
    FROM sales
    JOIN members
    ON sales.customer_id=members.customer_id
    WHERE order_date>=join_date
)

SELECT customer_id, product_name, order_date
FROM date_rank
JOIN menu
ON date_rank.product_id=menu.product_id
WHERE ranking = 1
ORDER BY customer_id
;
````

#### Reasoning
- Create ```date_rank``` CTE and include a **ROW_NUMBER** function to give each row a value, seperated by ```customer_id``` and ordered by ```order_date``` in ascending order
- Join the ```members``` table with the ```sales``` table so that we can filter the results to only when ```order_date``` is greater or equal to the ```join_date```
- Using the ```date_rank``` CTE, create a new select statement which joins the ```menu``` table as well, allowing us to know the name of the product ordered
- Further restrict the results to where the row number(labeled as ranking) is equal to 1 to show the first product ordered after becoming a member

#### Answer:
| customer_id | product_name | order_date |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | curry    | 2021-01-07    |
| B           | sushi    | 2021-01-11    |

From the query above we see that the first product ordered by each customer after becoming a member was curry for customer A, and sushi for customer B.

### 7. Which item was purchased just before the customer became a member?

````sql
WITH prior_member_purchased_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, m.join_date, s.order_date, s.product_id,
         DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY s.customer_id
         ORDER BY s.order_date DESC) AS rank
   FROM sales AS s
   JOIN members AS m
      ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
   WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
)

SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m2.product_name 
FROM prior_member_purchased_cte AS s
JOIN menu AS m2
   ON s.product_id = m2.product_id
WHERE rank = 1;
````

#### Steps:
- Create a ```prior_member_purchased_cte``` to create new column ```rank``` by using **Windows function** and partitioning ```customer_id``` by descending ```order_date``` to find out the last ```order_date``` before customer becomes a member.
- Filter ```order_date``` before ```join_date```.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | order_date  | product_name |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  sushi        |
| A           | 2021-01-01 |  curry        |
| B           | 2021-01-04 |  sushi        |

- Customer Aâ€™s last order before becoming a member is sushi and curry.
- Whereas for Customer B, it's sushi. That must have been a real good sushi!

***

### 8. What is the total items and amount spent for each member before they became a member?

````sql
SELECT s.customer_id, COUNT(DISTINCT s.product_id) AS unique_menu_item, 
   SUM(mm.price) AS total_sales
FROM sales AS s
JOIN members AS m
   ON s.customer_id = m.customer_id
JOIN menu AS mm
   ON s.product_id = mm.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < m.join_date
GROUP BY s.customer_id;

````

#### Steps:
- Filter ```order_date``` before ```join_date``` and perform a **COUNT** **DISTINCT** on ```product_id``` and **SUM** the ```total spent``` before becoming member.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | unique_menu_item | total_sales |
| ----------- | ---------- |----------  |
| A           | 2 |  25       |
| B           | 2 |  40       |

Before becoming members,
- Customer A spent $ 25 on 2 items.
- Customer B spent $40 on 2 items.

***

### 9. If each $1 spent equates to 10 points and sushi has a 2x points multiplier â€” how many points would each customer have?

````sql
WITH price_points AS
(
   SELECT *, 
      CASE
         WHEN product_id = 1 THEN price * 20
         ELSE price * 10
      END AS points
   FROM menu
)

SELECT s.customer_id, SUM(p.points) AS total_points
FROM price_points_cte AS p
JOIN sales AS s
   ON p.product_id = s.product_id
GROUP BY s.customer_id
````

#### Steps:
Letâ€™s breakdown the question.
- Each $1 spent = 10 points.
- But, sushi (product_id 1) gets 2x points, meaning each $1 spent = 20 points
So, we use CASE WHEN to create conditional statements
- If product_id = 1, then every $1 price multiply by 20 points
- All other product_id that is not 1, multiply $1 by 10 points
Using ```price_points```, **SUM** the ```points```.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 860 |
| B           | 940 |
| C           | 360 |

- Total points for Customer A is 860.
- Total points for Customer B is 940.
- Total points for Customer C is 360.

### 10. 10. In the first week after a customer joins the program (including their join date) they earn 2x points on all items, not just sushi â€” how many points do customer A and B have at the end of January?

````sql
WITH dates_cte AS 
(
   SELECT *, 
      DATEADD(DAY, 6, join_date) AS valid_date, 
      EOMONTH('2021-01-31') AS last_date
   FROM members AS m
)

SELECT d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, d.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price,
   SUM(CASE
      WHEN m.product_name = 'sushi' THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
      WHEN s.order_date BETWEEN d.join_date AND d.valid_date THEN 2 * 10 * m.price
      ELSE 10 * m.price
      END) AS points
FROM dates_cte AS d
JOIN sales AS s
   ON d.customer_id = s.customer_id
JOIN menu AS m
   ON s.product_id = m.product_id
WHERE s.order_date < d.last_date
GROUP BY d.customer_id, s.order_date, d.join_date, d.valid_date, d.last_date, m.product_name, m.price
````

#### Steps:
- In ```dates_cte```, find out customerâ€™s ```valid_date``` (which is 6 days after ```join_date``` and inclusive of ```join_date```) and ```last_day``` of Jan 2021 (which is â€˜2021â€“01â€“31â€™).

Our assumptions are:
- On Day -X to Day 1 (customer becomes member on Day 1 ```join_date```), each $1 spent is 10 points and for sushi, each $1 spent is 20 points.
- On Day 1 ```join_date``` to Day 7 ```valid_date```, each $1 spent for all items is 20 points.
- On Day 8 to ```last_day``` of Jan 2021, each $1 spent is 10 points and sushi is 2x points.

#### Answer:
| customer_id | total_points | 
| ----------- | ---------- |
| A           | 1370 |
| B           | 820 |

- Total points for Customer A is 1,370.
- Total points for Customer B is 820.

### Rank All The Things - Danny also requires further information about the ```ranking``` of customer products, but he purposely does not need the ranking for non-member purchases so he expects null ```ranking``` values for the records when customers are not yet part of the loyalty program.

````sql
WITH summary_cte AS 
(
   SELECT s.customer_id, s.order_date, m.product_name, m.price,
      CASE
      WHEN mm.join_date > s.order_date THEN 'N'
      WHEN mm.join_date <= s.order_date THEN 'Y'
      ELSE 'N' END AS member
   FROM sales AS s
   LEFT JOIN menu AS m
